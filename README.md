Navigating the job market in Belize can be difficult for both University of Belize graduate students and students seeking internships as per their course curriculum. This system should support students in their search for jobs relative to their field and experience and help companies find talented students from UB. Factors which have to be taken into account in building such a system are:

-Students will be able to view jobs made available by companies

-Students may apply for posted jobs and receive feedback about their application status.

-Information about students, including their resumes, is provided to the system and can be viewed by potential employment companies.

-All students may view information regarding any particular job.

-Website will handle documents sent between student and employer.

-Communication between student and employer to ensure a seamless process of recruitment.
